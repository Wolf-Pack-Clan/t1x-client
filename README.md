making a c1cx replacement, using the codebase of iw4x-sp and iw6-mod, so instead of using dll injection, it bootstraps

The goal is to no longer trigger Windows antivirus, and obtain a more modern base which would make it easier to take elements from client extensions of newer cod versions

i upload before ready to use in case some people would like to see/participate

currently i need to rename cod-mod.exe to mohaa.exe for the game to run on both my intel hd graphics and amd pc
