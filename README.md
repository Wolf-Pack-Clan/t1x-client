# Client modification for [CoD1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_(video_game))

Replacing [c1cx](https://github.com/cod1dev/c1cx), using the codebase of modern CoD mods, bootstrapping the original client .exe instead of using DLL injection.  
The goal is to no longer trigger Windows antivirus, and obtain a source code closer to modern CoD mods, making it easier to take elements from them.
