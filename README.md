> [!NOTE]
> Replacing [c1cx](https://github.com/cod1dev/c1cx), using the codebase of modern CoD mods, bootstrapping the original client .exe instead of using DLL injection.

The goal is to no longer trigger Windows antivirus, and obtain a source code closer to modern CoD mods, making it easier to take elements from them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You might need to rename `cod-mod.exe` to `mohaa.exe` for the game to run.
