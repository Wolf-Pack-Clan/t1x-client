attempting to make a c1cx replacement, using the codebase of iw4x-sp and iw6-mod, so instead of using a .exe to inject a .dll into codmp, it would just use a single .exe to bootstrap codmp

currently not working -> when starting cod-mod.exe, it starts codmp, but then it gets closed

i upload now anyway in case some people would like to see/participate

The goal is to no longer trigger Windows antivirus, and obtain a more modern base which would make it easier to take elements from client extensions of newer cod versions
